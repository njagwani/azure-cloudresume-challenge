# Azure-CloudResume-Challenge

Hello!!!ðŸ¥³

This is the repository of my first [A Cloud Guru Resume Challenge](https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/cloudguruchallenge-your-resume-in-azure) 

I started off the project by building the frontend which will contain your Website. 

At first, I created my own github repository for Azure Cloud Resume Challenge. 

### Resume Template
In order to get started, I first had to create my own Resume. In order to create my Resume, I decide to use a Resume template which is based on n beautiful resume NuxtJs code developed by [Ivan Greve](https://github.com/ivangreve/nuxt-resume) and 
[StartBootstrap Theme](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-resume/)

Commands used to build Resume template based on NuxtJs code:
1. Install NodeJS (Pre-requisite)
2. $npm install - To install dependencies
3. $npm run build - To Build application
4. $npm run dev - To Run in Dev Mode
5. $npm run generate - To generate static code, all generated code will appear in ./dist folder

Changes made to locales/en to with own Resume details like Name, Experience, Certifications, Skills, Linkedin links, Github links etc.

I made a few changes on the layout of my Resume template.

Frontend pretty much has all the contents from the ./dist folder & main.js (Created seperately which contains Java script code for visitor counter functionality).

Index.html contains the element for the counter <id="counter"> to display the counter info.
